This is taken and modified from a technical test I was once given. Below is the original brief:

- You will build an app that works across a range of device sizes.
- The app will load the current hot submissions from the Android subreddit. You can use https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/hot.json to get posts.
- The posts will be displayed in a list view.
- If the user scrolls to the bottom of the list, the app should load the next page of results.
- If the user taps on a post, they should be taken to that post on reddit.
- Each post should give attribution to the author
